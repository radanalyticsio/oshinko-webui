### Running the app during development

You'll need to have a node environment installed (developed using NodeJS v6.3.1).
You might prefer to use nvm (https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
to manage your node environment.
Once that is set up, you can run the following:

    npm install
    npm install -g bower
    bower install

Now you're ready to run the oshinko-webui server.

Set the following environment variables:

    OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_PORT=<port for the webui server to listen on, default is 8080>    
    OSHINKO_WEB_DEBUG=<true to get extra log entries, false by default> 
    OSHINKO_CLI_LOCATION=<path to oshinko-cli, default is /usr/src/app/oshinko-cli>
    OSHINKO_SA_TOKEN=<token for oshinko serviceaccount, enpty by default>
    KUBERNETES_CERT=<path to ca.crt file, /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt by default>
    KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST=<hostname of kubernetes service, default is kubernetes.default>
    KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT=<port where the kubernetes service is listening, default is 443>
    USE_INSECURE_CLI=<true if you don't want to use tls validation and don't require ca.crt, false by default>
    
You can pick one of these options:

* install node.js and run `node server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>` to see the app running in
your browser.


### Running the app in production
The oshinko-webui is meant to run inside Openshift.  You can build the image
from the Dockerfile.  The resultant image can be run standalone or inside
Openshift.  If you are running in standalone mode, you may need to manually
set some of the environment variables listed in the previous section.


### Running unit tests
To run the unit tests:

    karma start test/karma.conf.js


### End to end testing
You'll need protractor installed:

    npm install -g protractor

<optional> Then run:

    webdriver-manager update

You may need to update `test/conf.js` to point to your correct `baseUrl` [default is `http://localhost:8080`] Or, you can pass `--baseUrl=<your baseUrl>` on the protractor command line

    webdriver-manager start

From another terminal window, you can run:

    protractor test/conf.js
